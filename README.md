# Smart-parking

this is an arduino project I did in college (ECE => Electronics and communication enginering) `(year 2021/2022)`

### Features

- Auto detecting number of available parking slots
- Only opens if there are free parking slots
- Tells the client which parking slots are free
- Alert clients if a car is leaving (when parking is full)
- Calculate parking price and show it to clients on their way out
- Auto close after 5 seconds of inactivity

### Components

1. Arduino uno R3
2. I2C LCD (16 x 2)
3. IR proximity sensor
4. Servo motor (SG90)
5. Bread board

### Possible upgrades

- More parking slots
- Show map on entrance (LCDÂ upgrade)
- Ask for help button
- Website for managing the system
- QR for each client to check his account on the website
- Client choose to pay later with his account
